# assetBundleUpdater

 Component to update your bundles and settings from remote. 
 Very specific component, but you can rewrite it for your tasks. Works with Firebase RealtimeDatabase to get remote settings and google disk to download bundles / files
 This script sets up the necessary components for updating the program, checks authentication status, and handles the loading and updating of Firebase remote configuration and asset bundles. It also manages the loading panel UI and provides methods for logging out and quitting the application.
